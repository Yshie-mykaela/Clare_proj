<h1 style="text-align:center;"> <font face="WildWest"> What is Bleach? </font></h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"> <font face="WildWest" size= "3"> Bleach is the general name for any chemical product that is used industrially or at home to remove color <br>from fabric, fiber, and other textiles, or to disinfect after cleaning. It can come in either solid or liquid forms.</font></p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;"> <font face="WildWest"><b> A Brief History of Bleach </b></font></h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <font face="WildWest" size= "3"> <b>Did you know?</b> The history of bleaching as a process can extend back to our
ancestors from prehistoric times!<br> There's proof of our primitive ancestors exposing items to sunlight for the purpose of bleaching. <br><br>

But the oldest traces can be found in the Egyptian civilization, at around <b>5000 BC.</b> The people of that time used<br> a solution which was developed from wood ashes and mixed with water to form lye. This substance had the<br> power to whiten linen. However, one had to exert extra care when using the solution as it was quite strong and<br> could dissolve linen when dipped for a long period of time.<br><br>

By the <b>11th-12th century AD,</b> The Dutch emerged as laundering experts and contributed an important<br> modification to the European community. They used sour milk to soften the harsh effects of lye. However, they<br> kept this secret formula to themselves, and the process remained a mystery for many years.<br><br>

Come Joe Roebuck in <b>1746,</b> who started using diluted sulphuric acid instead of sour milk. This greatly helped to<br> cut the time needed for the bleaching procedure to only 12 to 24 hours from the former six weeks to two months.<br> This allowed the linen trade to become quite profitable.<br><br>

In <b>1774,</b> Swedish chemist Karl Wilhelm Scheele discovered chlorine which had the ability to destroy vegetable<br> colors. This inspired French scientist Claude Berthollet to its addition to the bleaching process. However, with<br> the health risks posed by the early experiments, this exercise was met with failure.<br><br>

Finally, in the year <b>1799,</b> the greatest push to the bleaching industry came when Charles Tennant introduced the<br> use of chloride of lime, leading to the substance presently known as bleaching powder. <br></font></p>



<p style="text-align:center;"> <font face="WildWest" size= "3"> It uses the formula <b>NaOCl</b> (Sodium, Oxygen, and Chlorine). It is an <u> Inorganic Alkaline</u> chemical compound. <br>It's Molar Mass is <b>74.44 g/mol.</b> Many household bleach solutions contain 5.25% sodium hypochlorite,<br> and a 1:10 dilution (5250 pm
Cl) will produce a 0.53% hypochlorite solution. Use of bleach solutions<br> with lower hypochlorite concentrations will not provide the proper level of disinfection.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> <font face="WildWest" size= "3"> In addition to sodium hypochlorite and water, small amounts of sodium chloride, sodium carbonate, and<br> sodium hydroxide are included for product stability and to maintain pH. Sodium chlorate is naturally present<br> in small amounts as an intermediate molecule during the natural breakdown of bleach to saltwater.

<h1 style="text-align:center;"> <font face="WildWest"> Hazards and Precautionary Measures</font></h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <font face="WildWest" size= "3"> The corrosive nature of bleach and its abundance in most homes turns it into a safety hazard.<br> <i>Children are especially at risk.</i> Keep the following hazards in mind when handling bleach:</font></p>

<ul>

<li>Bleach can cause irritation to the skin and eyes
<li>Vapours may cause irritation to the throat (esophagus) and lungs
<li>Dangerous gasses can form when bleach is combined with certain chemicals
<li>Bleach can worsen a person's existing asthma condition, or cause asthma to a person without it
<li>Bleach causes buildup of chloroform (a known cancer-causing chemical) in the air
<li>Breathing in bleach over a long period of time can increase the risk of cancer

</ul>
</div>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <font face="WildWest" size= "3">Therefore, one must make sure to employ proper precautionary measures when handling the product. Such as: </font></p>

<ol>

<li>Wear proper PPE such as eye protection, gloves, and clothing
<li>Open the container and mix out of doors or in a well-ventilated room to avoid vapor buildup
<li>Thoroughly wash your hands with mild soap and water before using the bathroom,<br> eating, and smoking or use smokeless tobacco
<li>Thoroughly shower and wash yourself with soap and shampoo at the end of the day
<li>Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the safe use of bleach
<li>Label containers clearly, do not use unlabelled containers or those with unreadable labels
<li>Never mix with other products, especially with other cleaners containing ammonia
<li>Keep the bleach away from metals

</ol>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <font face="WildWest" size= "3"><i>Store bleach in a safe, cool, dry place. Keep away from direct sunlight and heat.<br> Close the cap tightly after use. Keep away from children.</i></font></p>

    <dd>Using bleach to clean your toilets, bathtubs, and sinks can guarantee you a disinfected bathroom. Just use a little bleach on your bathroom fixtures and leave it overnight. <br>Do this if your toilet flushes on your septic tank as it depends on anaerobic bacteria to break down waste.    </dd> </br> 
  <dt> <b> Disinfect children’s toys</dt> </b>
<dd> Germs can be found on toys, especially if it was used by children or second-hand. <br> With the help of bleach, you can remove those germs easily which makes <br>  the toys safe for your kids. </dd> </p>
<dt> <b> Kill Weeds </dt> </b>
<dd> Weeds are harmful to your plants as they take up the nutrients your plants need to grow. <br> To kill weeds in your garden, use undiluted bleach to remove it. </dd> </center>
